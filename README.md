# Weather Data Analysis Project

## Current Status
- Attempted to utilize the Weatherlink History API using the existing "Weatherlink History API - Daily.ipynb" notebook
- Currently experiencing credential/authentication issues with the API implementation
- Successfully downloaded alternative datasets directly from the Weatherlink website
  - Note: These datasets are in a different format compared to API-sourced data

## Next Steps
1. Troubleshoot and resolve API authentication issues in the notebook
   - Verify API credentials
   - Debug authentication flow
   - Test API connectivity

2. If API issues persist:
   - Develop data transformation process to standardize downloaded datasets
   - Create alternative data ingestion pipeline for manually downloaded data

## Available Resources
- Local weather datasets (downloaded from Weatherlink website)
- Existing API integration notebook
- Weatherlink API documentation

## Technical Notes
- Data format differences exist between API downloads and manual downloads
- Need to maintain compatibility with existing analysis pipeline
